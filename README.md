# AlgoCircles
AlgoCircles is a processing project containing my experiments with generative design. Originating from the same analog algorythm (phenotype), I created different modifications, which could be used in different scenarios. The 'grid_circle_visual' is an approach which could be used as a branding tool, generating different variations of the same logo-kind.
